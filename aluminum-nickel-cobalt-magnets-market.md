<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Aluminum-Nickel-Cobalt Magnets Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Cast Type</li><li>Sintered Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Aluminum-Nickel-Cobalt (AlNiCo) magnets are available in two main types: cast and sintered. Cast AlNiCo magnets are created by pouring molten metal into molds, allowing for complex shapes and superior magnetic properties, making them ideal for applications requiring strong and stable magnetism. Sintered AlNiCo magnets, on the other hand, are produced by compacting powdered alloys and heating them without melting. They typically offer higher strength and density but may have limitations in shape complexity compared to cast types.</p></p>
