<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Linear Smoke Detector Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Reflective</li><li>End to End</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Linear smoke detectors are categorized into two main types: reflective and end-to-end systems. Reflective linear smoke detectors utilize a light source and a receiver positioned within the same unit, detecting smoke by measuring changes in light intensity caused by smoke particles. In contrast, end-to-end systems consist of a light source and receiver placed at opposite ends of a defined area, where smoke interruption between them triggers an alarm. Both types are designed for early smoke detection over long distances in various environments.</p></p>
